# Code Review Challenge

This is a sample repo containing some code to be reviewed by candidates as part of their interview process.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new private repository on GitHub so others can't copy your work.
3. Push your local clone up to your private repository while preserving history.
4. Create a pull request in your private repo to merge the `feature-art-search` branch into the `main` branch.
5. Add a review of the code as though you were looking at a colleague's work.
   * Give feedback both for anything dangerous and anything that could be improved.
   * We're measuring for how well you spot and call things out.
   * Feel free to make any suggestions for code reorganization or alternate approaches.
6. Share your private repo with `jeromedane` or the reviewer(s) requested when you were sent this challenge
