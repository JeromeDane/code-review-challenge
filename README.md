# Code Review Challenge

This is a sample repo containing some code to be reviewed by candidates as part of their interview process.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new private repository on GitHub so others can't copy your work.
3. Push your local clone up to your private repository while preserving history.
4. Create a pull request in your private repo to merge the `feature-art-search` branch into the `main` branch.
5. Add a review of the code as though you were looking at a colleague's work.
6. Share your private repo with `jeromedane` or the reviewer(s) requested when you were sent this challenge

### Details

* Consider cloning and running the code locally so you can see how it works and test suggested changes.
* This exercise should _probably_ take you 30 minutes to an hour.
* We're looking to see how you think and measuring for how well you spot and call things out.
* The tone of your review should focus on helping a less experienced engineer improve.
* Give feedback for anything dangerous and anything that could be improved.
* Feel free to make any suggestions for code reorganization or alternate approaches.
